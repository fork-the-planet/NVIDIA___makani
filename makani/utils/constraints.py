class NonNegativeConstraint(nn.Module):
    """Enforce nonnegativity on a named subset of channels (dim -3, nchw layout).

    Normalization convention: x_norm = (x_raw - bias) / scale, so physical
    zero sits at x_norm = -bias/scale. The offset = bias/scale is precomputed
    in the constructor so the forward pass is cheap.

    Training mode: a smooth soft clamp applied in the shifted (physical-zero-centered)
    space so gradients flow for slightly negative values. Two shapes are available via
    ``mode``:

      - "silu" (default): ``x * sigmoid(x/eps)``. Smooth, but *non-monotonic* -- it dips
        below zero for x < 0 with a negative gradient there. For a channel whose target
        sits at the physical-zero floor (e.g. stratospheric specific humidity q50), that
        negative-side gradient drives the prediction ever more negative until the gradient
        vanishes, a self-reinforcing collapse to 0 with no way back.
      - "softplus": a leaky blend ``leak*x + (1-leak)*eps*(softplus(x/eps) - ln2)``. Monotonic
        (gradient > 0 everywhere) so a below-target prediction is always pushed up, with a
        gradient floor of ``leak`` so an already-collapsed channel can still recover. The
        ``-ln2`` constant pins the floor to a fixed point at physical zero (w(0)=0), matching
        the eval hard-clamp floor: without it the raw ``softplus`` sits ~(1-leak)*eps*ln2 above
        physical zero, biasing genuinely-dry channels (e.g. stratospheric q50) upward. The loss
        then drives raw predictions negative to cancel that bias, and the inference hard clamp
        flattens them to 0 -- a collapse routed through the floor mismatch rather than a negative
        gradient. It is identity minus a negligible ~(1-leak)*eps*ln2 on the bulk, matching "silu"
        spectrally.

    Eval/inference mode (both): hard clamp, guaranteeing x_raw >= 0 before any
    downstream conservation corrections.

        names_to_clamp: list of channel names to enforce nonnegativity on.

class HydrostaticBalanceProjection(nn.Module):
    r"""Softly enforce hydrostatic balance by projecting the (T, Z) sub-state onto
    the balance manifold, leaving the model free to predict T and Z independently.

    Unlike the reparametrizing ``_HydrostaticBalanceWrapper`` (which derives the
    full temperature column from the geopotentials and thereby discards L-1
    degrees of freedom), this layer takes the model's freely-predicted T and Z
    columns and applies the *minimum-norm* differentiable correction that makes
    them satisfy the discrete hydrostatic relation

        Z_i - Z_{i-1} = c_i (T_i + T_{i-1}),   c_i = 0.5 * R_dry * log(p_{i-1}/p_i).

    Stacking one column as x = [T_0..T_{L-1}, Z_0..Z_{L-1}] (physical units), the
    L-1 relations form a linear system A x = 0. The orthogonal projection onto
    ker A is x' = x - A^T (A A^T)^{-1} A x. The correction is distributed across
    both T and Z (minimum-norm) rather than dumped entirely onto T.

    The projection is carried out in *normalized* coordinates (metric W =
    diag(1/scale^2)) so a correction is measured in sigma units and shared
    fairly between variables whose physical magnitudes differ by orders of
    magnitude (geopotential ~ 1e4 vs temperature ~ 1e2). With the affine offset
    from the normalization bias folded in, the forward pass is a single 1x1
    conv plus a bias, with everything precomputed in the constructor.

    A ``strength`` (lambda) in [0, 1] damps the correction: 1.0 enforces balance
    exactly at the output, < 1.0 nudges toward the manifold while letting some
    residual imbalance through. Already-balanced states are left untouched at
    any strength.

    A ``climatology_offset`` makes the target manifold affine, ``A x = b_clim``
    instead of the homogeneous ``A x = 0``. This is useful for reanalysis data
    (e.g. ERA5 on pressure levels) which carries a systematic hydrostatic residual
    from the model-level -> pressure-level interpolation: pinning the residual to
    its climatological mean preserves that systematic imbalance (so scores against
    the reanalysis are not penalized) while still constraining the residual's
    fluctuations (so autoregressive rollouts stay on a consistent manifold). The
    offset is a per-interior-level residual b_clim in physical geopotential units
    (m^2/s^2); b_clim[i-1] is the expected value of
    ``(Z_i - Z_{i-1}) - c_i (Tv_i + Tv_{i-1})``. It is expected to be computed over
    *all* matching z/t pressure levels (as get_hydrostatic_balance_climatology does),
    so its length must be ``(#matching z/t levels) - 1``; the constructor verifies
    this and slices out the contiguous subset for the requested [p_min, p_max]
    window, relying on the metadata-consistent channel ordering rather than an
    explicit level file. ``None`` (default) recovers the homogeneous projection.

    Moist-air variant (``use_moist_air_formula=True``): the relation uses virtual
    temperature T_v = T (1 + eps q), which is bilinear in (T, q) and would break a
    linear projection. We hold the predicted specific humidity q fixed (balance
    should not rewrite moisture) and project in (T_v, Z) variables, where the
    constraint is *structurally identical* to the dry one and reuses the same
    operator: convert T -> T_v, project, then recover T = T_v / (1 + eps q).
    Because the T_v conversion is a physical-units operation, the whole projection
    is carried out in physical units (un-normalize -> project -> re-normalize);
    the weighted physical projection P = W^{-1} A^T (A W^{-1} A^T)^{-1} A with
    W = diag(1/scale^2) is algebraically identical to the normalized-space form,
    so the dry path is unchanged.

        channel_names:         full list of channel names for the model output.
        bias:                  normalization bias tensor, shape (1, C, 1, 1) or None.
